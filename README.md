# Archeologie monitor scripts

In order to run these scripts it is recommended to follow the installation instructions of the [introduction to geospatial python](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/geospatial-python/#software-setup) course.

The script uses the following libraries:
- geopandas
- requests
- pathlib
- fiona
- pandas

In case one of the packages is not installed, you can do that in a jupyter notebook by:

```python
!pip install geopandas
```
